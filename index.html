			<h1>What is a vector?</h1s>
            <p>Computer graphics best friend, the vector has a long storied 
                history stretching back centuries. Starting as the humble tool of mathematicians used help explain the world around us, its uses have grown over time to fill many niches.</p>
            <p>The classical definition of a vector is something that contains both a magnitude (or length) and a direction. This definition is a bit confusing on its face so we won't dwell on it too long. What is important to take from this definition is that a vector is a singular object composed of multiple distinct parts. A vector composed of two parts is referred to as a 2D vector, a vector with three parts is referred to as 3D vector, four parts 4D, 5 parts 5D, and so on into infinity. For our needs we won't be going beyond 4D vectors.</p>

			<h1>Applications</h1>
                <h2>How can They be used? </h2>
                <p>Now that we have a basic understand of what makes a vector let’s take a look at some examples of vectors used in computer graphics. </p>
                <p> An example of a vector used in computer graphics would be position of an object. Now because we live in the future we can represent position in both the second and third dimension. </p>
                <p> A 2D position vector could be represented like this: <b>(X,Y).</b> Where <b>X</b> denotes how far left or right on the screen the object is, while <b>Y</b> denotes how far up or down something is. If you have ever played a 2D Mario game Mario’s position on the screen can be represented by a 2D vector. </p> 
                <p>A 3D position vector is just a 2D vector with an extra part and can be represented like this: <b>(X,Y,Z).</b> Where just like the 2D vector you have <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> controlling 2 different directions <b>Z</b> is now a third direction we can go.</p>
                <p> While mathematically possible to create and work with a 4D position vector it would confuse our poor little 3D minds so instead we will use color as our example of a 4D vector.</p> 
                <p>A 4D color vector can represented like this: <b>(<span style="color:#FF0000">R</span>,<span style="color:#00ff00">G</span>,<span style="color:#0095ff">B</span>,A)</b>. Unlike the last two vectors where the numbers that made up the parts of the vector could theoretically be any number value the numbers that make up the color vector usually go between 0 and 255. This is due to some computer bit byte nonsense that wont be of importance here, its just the standard. The screen your reading this on is made up of tiny little dots called pixels. Every pixel has with it a 4D color vector telling that pixel what color it should be. The <b>R</b>, <b>G</b>, and <b>B</b> components control how red, green, and blue, a pixel is while the A which stands for alpha controls how transparent or see through the pixel is. for example a <b>(<span style="color:#FF0000">255</span>,<span style="color:#00ff00">0</span>,<span style="color:#0095ff">0</span>,255)</b> is a pure red pixel while the color <b>(<span style="color:#FF0000">255</span>,<span style="color:#00ff00">0</span>,<span style="color:#0095ff">255</span>,255)</b> would be half full red and half full blue so they would mix and form a bright pinkish purple color, and the color <b>(<span style="color:#FF0000">0</span>,<span style="color:#00ff00">255</span>,<span style="color:#0095ff">0</span>,128)</b> would be full green but at half alpha meaning it would blend 50% transparent (there is not actually a pixel behind other pixels some fancy math just blends the two colors together)</p>
